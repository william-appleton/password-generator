# password-generator
Random password generator 

For this project interactive Javascript was added to create a random password when a button is pressed. The user is prompted to include or exclude different character types, and is asked to specify a password length. If no character type is selected the user sees an alert that asks them to choose at least one type, and if the length they ask for is outside the parameters given (or not a number) then they are also alerted. The code then runs based off the provided inputs and generates a random password made of the specified characters that is the specified length. This password is then displayed in the text area on the page for the user to see.
